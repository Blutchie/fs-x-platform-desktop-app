  <h2>Template Fullstack X-Platform Desktop App</h2>
  <h3>
    Ionic / Electron / Dotnet Core / SQLite
  </h3>
  <p>
    This is a template to create full stack cross platform desktop applications with a web technology front-end, dotnet core back-end and sqlite storage capabilities. I had big plans (which I will mention in a later chapter), but because of lack of time I didn't get further than a proof of concept / template project.
